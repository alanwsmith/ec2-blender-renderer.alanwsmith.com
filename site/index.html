      <h1>Amazon AWS EC2 Render Times And Prices</h1>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve recently started to get into blender. I was more than a little
        put off by the amount of time it takes to render. So, I figured I'd look
        around for faster options. There are some online services. Their pricing
        is hard to figure. I'm still looking into them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the mean time, I ran some tests with AWS EC2 instances to see how
        much it would cost to get things done that way. The chart below shows
        details on how long a render took and what it cost to make it.
      </p>
      <p>More notes are below</p>

      <h2>Under Construction</h2>
      <p>
        This page is still a draft. I'm still adding data, note, and cleaning
        things up

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These times are for rendings of the
          <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/cycles/loft.blend"
            >loft file</a
          >
          from the
          <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/cycles/"
            >Blender cycles demo files</a
          >
          on Amazon AWS EC2 instances. You can download it and time a render to
          do a comparison
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm not interested in animation at this point. Just still frames. So
          this look at the serivces is in that light
        </li>
        <li>
          The renders were done with 'CUDA' on the windows machine and EC2
          instances and 'METAL' for the mac
        </li>
        <li>
          My 2021 M1 Max MacBookPro (model 18.4) with 64GB of memory and windows
          machine with a NVIDIA GTX 1080 card in it are also listed as 'MBP' and
          '1080' respectively
        </li>
        <li>The prices are based on On-Demand usage at the time I ran them</li>
        <li>The octanebench score on my windows machine is 135.33.</li>
        <li>
          I tried to run octanebench on my mac but it says no supported GPU is
          found
        </li>
        <li>
          The methodology was to do three renders of the file. The longest time
          was thrown out and the other two were averaged
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <a
            href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ec2-blender-renderer.alanwsmith.com/tree/main/scripts/profile_machine/results"
            >raw results are here</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          The prices do not include startup and shutdown times for the EC2
          instances. That cost would need to be calculated based on the use case
        </li>
        <li>
          There will also be some cost for the first time you setup a machine to
          get all the installs in place. (An AMI could take care of that aspect
          though)
        </li>
        <li>
          You have to request quota updates to get access to the 'p' and 'g'
          type instances. As of press time, this is
          <a
            href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas"
            >the page to request quota increases</a
          >. Search for 'demand'. Then put in requests for 'Running On-Demand G
          and VT instances' and 'Running On-Demand P instances'. The biggest
          machine 'p' instance is 96 vCPU and the biggest 'g' is 192. They
          didn't give me the 192 max on the 'g' instances the first time I
          asked.
        </li>
        <li>
          The p4d.24xlarge was not available in `us-east-1a` when i tested.
          (TODO confirm if you did `1b`, `1c`, or `1d` based off the error
          message
        </li>
        <li>
          I looked at <a href="https://garagefarm.net">garagefarm.net</a> and
          from what I can tell from their pricing calculator the minumum chart
          is &dollar;1.
        </li>
        <li>
          The time from garagefarm said 0h 0min. So, not sure how long it would
          actually take.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="https://blendergrid.com">blendergrid.com</a> pricing
          calculor isn't much help with single frame setups and doesn't look
          like it's working right for me. I adjusted the number of notes from 5
          to 50 and the price didn't change which seems weird. ,
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://render.st/plans-pricing/">render steet</a> estimate:
          &dollar;1.09 - finishing in 1-2 hours. These places seem to be much
          more about animations than single frames.
        </li>
        <li>
          You could have some hitches starting and stopping the machines. It
          looks like the system that keeps track of the number of vCPUs you have
          running isn't updated live. I've had cases where I've shut an instance
          down then tried to start it back a minute or so later and couldn't
          because it said I hit the vCPU limit. After waiting a bit, it fixed
          itself and I could launch again
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes you get an error like this if there isn't enough capacity on
          the AWS site: An error occurred (InsufficientInstanceCapacity) when
          calling the RunInstances operation (reached max retries: 2): We
          currently do not have sufficient p3.8xlarge capacity in the
          Availability Zone you requested (us-east-1c). Our system will be
          working on provisioning additional capacity. You can currently get
          p3.8xlarge capacity by not specifying an Availability Zone in your
          request or choosing us-east-1b, us-east-1d, us-east-1f.
        </li>
