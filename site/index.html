        <h1>Amazon AWS EC2 Blender Rendering Times And Prices</h1>

        <h2>TL;DR</h2>

        <p>For about twenty cents I can render a Blender image in two minutes that would take nineteen minutes on my machine.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve recently started to get into blender. I was more than a little
          put off by the amount of time it takes to render. I figured I&apos;d look
          around for faster options. There are some online services. Their pricing
          is hard to figure. I'm still looking into them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the mean time, I ran some tests with AWS EC2 instances to see how
          much it would cost to get things done that way. After going through just about all the EC2 instances with GPUs I 
          
          The chart below shows
          details on how long a render took and what it cost to make it.
        </p>
        <p>More notes are below</p>
        <h2>Under Construction</h2>
        <p>
          This page is still a draft. I'm still adding data, note, and cleaning
          things up
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="chart_wrapper">
        <canvas id="barChartCanvas"></canvas>
      </div>
      

      <div class="prose_wrapper">
        <h3>Draft Notes (In No Particular Order)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These times are for rendings of the
            <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/cycles/loft.blend"
              >loft file</a
            >
            from the
            <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/cycles/"
              >Blender cycles demo files</a
            >
            on Amazon AWS EC2 instances. You can download it and time a render to
            do a comparison
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm not interested in animation at this point. Just still frames. So
            this look at the serivces is in that light
          </li>
          <li>
            The renders were done with 'CUDA' on the windows machine and EC2
            instances and 'METAL' for the mac
          </li>
          <li>
            My 2021 M1 Max MacBookPro (model 18.4) with 64GB of memory and windows
            machine with a NVIDIA GTX 1080 card in it are also listed as 'MBP' and
            '1080' respectively
          </li>
          <li>The prices are based on On-Demand usage at the time I ran them</li>
          <li>The octanebench score on my windows machine is 135.33.</li>
          <li>
            I tried to run octanebench on my mac but it says no supported GPU is
            found
          </li>
          <li>
            The methodology was to do three renders of the file. The longest time
            was thrown out and the other two were averaged
          </li>
          <li>
            The
            <a
              href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ec2-blender-renderer.alanwsmith.com/tree/main/scripts/profile_machine/results"
              >raw results are here</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            The prices do not include startup and shutdown times for the EC2
            instances. That cost would need to be calculated based on the use case
          </li>
          <li>
            There will also be some cost for the first time you setup a machine to
            get all the installs in place. (An AMI could take care of that aspect
            though)
          </li>
          <li>
            You have to request quota updates to get access to the 'p' and 'g'
            type instances. As of press time, this is
            <a
              href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas"
              >the page to request quota increases</a
            >. Search for 'demand'. Then put in requests for 'Running On-Demand G
            and VT instances' and 'Running On-Demand P instances'. The biggest
            machine 'p' instance is 96 vCPU and the biggest 'g' is 192. They
            didn't give me the 192 max on the 'g' instances the first time I
            asked.
          </li>
          <li>
            The p4d.24xlarge was not available in `us-east-1a` when i tested.
            (TODO confirm if you did `1b`, `1c`, or `1d` based off the error
            message
          </li>
          <li>
            I looked at <a href="https://garagefarm.net">garagefarm.net</a> and
            from what I can tell from their pricing calculator the minumum chart
            is &dollar;1.
          </li>
          <li>
            The time from garagefarm said 0h 0min. So, not sure how long it would
            actually take.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="https://blendergrid.com">blendergrid.com</a> pricing
            calculor isn't much help with single frame setups and doesn't look
            like it's working right for me. I adjusted the number of notes from 5
            to 50 and the price didn't change which seems weird. ,
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://render.st/plans-pricing/">render steet</a> estimate:
            &dollar;1.09 - finishing in 1-2 hours. These places seem to be much
            more about animations than single frames.
          </li>
          <li>
            You could have some hitches starting and stopping the machines. It
            looks like the system that keeps track of the number of vCPUs you have
            running isn't updated live. I've had cases where I've shut an instance
            down then tried to start it back a minute or so later and couldn't
            because it said I hit the vCPU limit. After waiting a bit, it fixed
            itself and I could launch again
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes you get an error like this if there isn't enough capacity on
            the AWS site: An error occurred (InsufficientInstanceCapacity) when
            calling the RunInstances operation (reached max retries: 2): We
            currently do not have sufficient p3.8xlarge capacity in the
            Availability Zone you requested (us-east-1c). Our system will be
            working on provisioning additional capacity. You can currently get
            p3.8xlarge capacity by not specifying an Availability Zone in your
            request or choosing us-east-1b, us-east-1d, us-east-1f.
          </li>
          <li>
            I had a bunch of problems with the g4dn.metal instance not wanting to
            start and seeming to hang. Could have been something with my script.
            Just not sure what happened.
          </li>
          <li>
            I tested most of the avaialble EC2 instances that have graphics cards.
            I filtered the data down to the set above based on the cost and time
            spent. The full dataset is in
            <a
              href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ec2-blender-renderer.alanwsmith.com"
              >the repo</a
            >
            if you'd like to dig into it.
          </li>
          <li>
            I ran all these tests with `CUDA`. I didn't do any with `CUDA+CPU` or
            the other rendering options. There may be some additional savings
            there, but worst case you get what's above.
          </li>
