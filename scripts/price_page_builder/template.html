    <h1>Amazon AWS EC2 Render Times And Prices</h1>
    <p>
      I&apos;ve recently started to get into blender. I was more than a little
      put off by the amount of time it takes to render. So, I figured I'd look
      around for faster options. Aside from the cloud

      <canvas id="barChartCanvas"></canvas>
    </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        These times are for rendings of the
        <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/cycles/loft.blend"
          >loft file</a
        >
        from the
        <a href="https://download.blender.org/demo/cycles/"
          >Blender cycles demo files</a
        >
        on Amazon AWS EC2 instances. You can download it and time a render to do
        a comparison
      </li>
      <li>
        The renders were done with 'CUDA' on the windows machine and EC2
        instances and 'METAL' for the mac
      </li>
      <li>
        My 2021 M1 Max MacBookPro (model 18.4) with 64GB of memory and windows
        machine with a NVIDIA 1080 card in it are also listed as 'MBP' and
        '1080' respectively
      </li>
      <li>The prices are based on On-Demand usage at the time I ran them</li>
      <li>
        I tried to run octanebench on my mac but it says no supported GPU is
        found
      </li>
      <li>
        The methodology was to do three renders of the file. The longest time
        was thrown out and the other two were averaged
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <a
          href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/ec2-blender-renderer.alanwsmith.com/tree/main/scripts/profile_machine/results"
          >raw results are here</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        The prices do not include startup and shutdown times for the EC2
        instances. That cost would need to be calculated based on the use case
      </li>
      <li>
        You have to request quota updates to get access to the 'p' and 'g' type
        instances. As of press time, this is
        <a
          href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas"
          >the page to request quota increases</a
        >. Search for 'demand'. Then put in requests for 'Running On-Demand G
        and VT instances' and 'Running On-Demand P instances'. The biggest
        machine 'p' instance is 96 vCPU and the biggest 'g' is 192. They didn't
        give me the 192 max on the 'g' instances the first time I asked.
      </li>

      <li>
        The p4d.24xlarge was not available in `us-east-1a` when i tested. (TODO
        confirm if you did `1b`, `1c`, or `1d` based off the error message
      </li>
    </ul>
